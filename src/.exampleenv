#Re-create this file with the name .env example is uploaded so that you know its a requirement.
#Assumptions to be changed.  DB server is Postgres, DB server IP is 172.22.27.92:5432, Username (username) and Password (password) and DB is application.
#Table Schema's are found in the models directory
#THE .ENV file must be placed above /src directory peered with cargo.toml
#Server IP is parsed as string and Server Port is parsed at u16.  So no quotes around port but quotes around IP. You can also use a FQDN instead of IP. However
#server will do a quick blocking of thread as it does DNS lookup to convert into IP address.
